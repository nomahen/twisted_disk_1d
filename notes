Testing if simulations will see dynamical accretion, similar to Nixon+King SPH paper "tearing up the disc". 

How I'm setting up the simulation: 

define critical radius r_c where we want to see accretion driven by counter rotation

reference simulation:
tilt = 0, prec = 0 everywhere, some density distribution; watch alpha-disk accrete

comparison simulation:
tilt = 0 everywhere; r < r_c prec = 0, r >= r_c prec = prec_c (180 degrees)
